## Minty's Silly Little Mod - Delicious Chocolatey Goodness for Balatro

A silly little mod that adds some silly little jokers and decks and things. It's chocolate because it's not vanilla. (It's not vanilla because I think calling a mod a word which in this context means "not modded" is silly.)

[Mod main page on Modded Balatro Wiki](https://balatromods.miraheze.org/wiki/Minty%27s_Silly_Little_Mod) (Beware of SPOILERS! If you even care about discovering things on your own, that is 😛)

Current features:
- Cats
- Cement
- Injokes
- Challenges
- Boss Blinds
- Several decks
- A bunch of jokers
- Cross-mod content
- A silly custom suit
- A little 3, as a treat
- Pencil-tool doodles for art
- Far more ambition than sense

Planned features:
- A booster
- More cats
- More cubes
- Maybe more decks
- Definitely more injokes
- Probably way more cross-mod content

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded), if you haven't already.
   - **Minimum supported version for 0.7.0 is [BETA-0711a](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-0711a)**. If the latest dev version fails for any reason, use the linked release.
3. Download the code from [the latest release](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/MintysSillyMod/releases).
4. Inside the zip file is the mod code in a folder, `MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION`. Put that folder in your Mods folder. The file structure should look like `Mods/MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION/MintysSillyMod.json`. In particular, there should _not_ be a second `MintysSillyMod` folder nested inside the first one. (You might prefer to remove the version number suffix from the folder name; it doesn't actually matter.)
5. Have a little 3 as a treat! :3

## To update to a newer version
1. Download the latest update.
2. Delete all files from your `Mods/MintysSillyMod` folder. (There's no save data in there, so you won't lose any progress.)
3. Unzip all the new files into the now-empty folder. Check again to make sure it's not nested.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Always start a new run after updating any mod. Attempting to continue an in-progress run may result in crashes.

## Config Options
<!-- - Balance level: Doesn't do anything yet but take a wild guess what the plan is. Yes we're jumping on this train. Blame [AikoShen](https://github.com/Aikoyori/Balatro-Aikoyoris-Shenanigans) for doing it second. -->
- Flavor text: Default true. Enables funky MtG-style quotes at the bottom of Jokers, and also some other cards.
- Include stable crossover content: Default false. Includes cross-mod content which doesn't actually rely on the other mod's code to function. Not really the intended experience (it'll bias the Joker pool toward 3s a lot), but you might prefer maximum access to things. Automatically on if Dev Mode is enabled.
- Rename Stone to Slate: Default true. This is really just for me; I'm persnickety, "stone" isn't a well-defined Thing, but slate is a real rock that [resembles your video game standard grey ahh chunk of generic](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=slate+rock&ia=images&iax=images). Turn this off if you're persnickety in an incompatible way where seeing it have a different name than vanilla would bug you.
- 3 lock: Whether the 3 suit and related content can appear in a run; "Unlocked" means it's available from the start, "Locked" means it requires using The Cat tarot or playing a Spectrum hand[^1], "Sealed" means it never appears unless a deck specifically enables it. Default "Locked".
- Dev Mode: Default false. Enables unfinished content if there is any (requires restart) (there usually isn't any anyway). 
   - Suppress trace messages: Default false; stops `TRACE`-level console messages even if Dev Mode is on.

## Recommended additional mods:
If you're trying out Minty's for the first time and want minimal other mods, go with [Talisman](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman) (unless you don't care about ^Mult as a concept), [Challenger Deep](https://github.com/OOkayOak/Challenger-Deep) (unless you don't care about challenges as a concept) and [Spectrum Framework](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/SpectrumFramework) (unless you don't care about the Spectrum hand as a concept). The rest of the list is for after that.

### Technical
- [Challenger Deep](https://github.com/OOkayOak/Challenger-Deep) is required for all challenges in Minty's Mod.
- [Spectrum Framework](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/SpectrumFramework) enables five-suit poker hands, which are a fun little thing to play with.
- [Talisman](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman) enables scores above e308 and also ^mult, which is just fun imo. Also very technically part of the next list (we have some ^mult Jokers).

### Cross-mod content
Minty's Mod adds content for all of the following mods. Those with ⭐️ are also recommended for just, like, a basic default content mod set. in my imo.
- [Aikoyori's Shenanigans](https://github.com/Aikoyori/Balatro-Aikoyoris-Shenanigans)
- [Card Sleeves](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves) ⭐️
- [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid)
- [Drafting](https://github.com/spire-winder/Balatro-Draft) ⭐️
- [Finity](https://github.com/frangnosquest/Finity)
- [Fusion Jokers](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/Fusion-Jokers) ⭐️
- [Gemstones](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/Gemstones)
- [More Fluff](https://github.com/notmario/MoreFluff) ⭐️
- [Ortalab](https://github.com/Eremel/Ortalab)
- [Paperback](https://github.com/GitNether/paperback) ⭐️
- [TOGA's Stuff](https://github.com/TheOneGoofAli/TOGAPackBalatro)

The following mods add content for Minty's Mod and we haven't returned the favor (yet):
- [Prism](https://github.com/blazingulag/Prism) ⭐️
- [Random's Partners](https://github.com/Random71777/Random-s-Partners) (requires [Partner](https://github.com/Icecanno/Partner-API/))

### Other content mods
Minty's Mod doesn't add anything for these _yet_, but we might in future. Until then, we're just recommending them because we like them. Consider anything on this list ⭐️'d.
- [KCVanilla](https://github.com/kcgidw/kcvanilla) is just a couple of Jokers but I like them a lot. and it was the first mod I found that organized its files so I'm giving it a shoutout for that reason (I figured out how to organize my files by looking at its code)
- [Rift-Raft](https://github.com/vitellaryjr/RiftRaft) lets you send cards to the Void and then later you can get them back as negative from Void Packs, it's fun

### Quality of life
Technically you can do whatever you want here, but here's the mods I like for the purpose:
- [Galdur](https://github.com/Eremel/Galdur) revamps the New Run screen to make deck and sleeve selection much easier.
- [Glue for Modpacks](https://github.com/icyethics/Glue-For-Modpacks) lets you adjust the shop so having a lot of mods doesn't drown everything out.
- [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) adds a whole lot of things but tbh the only one I care about is selecting multiple playing cards by dragging across them.
- [Item Remover](https://github.com/art-muncher/Item-Remover) lets you disable specific items from the Collection, if they're OP or bugged or you just don't like them. ([Banner](https://github.com/SylviBlossom/Banner) does the same thing and is newer, switch if one of them isn't doing what you want it to.)

## Adding cross-mod interactions
- 3 suit: If you want things to interact with the 3s mechanic, use `Card:is_3()` for proper detection. It returns the number of times the card counts as a 3, or `false` if it doesn't, because `0` is truthy in Lua...
- Face rank: If your modded suit includes Face art, give it `minty_facerank = true` to stop it from using the fallback art. Uh... I don't know how to properly implement cross-mod suit-rank combo art. I'll ask Kirbio UnStable, maybe. (Where by "ask" I mean "look in his published code".)
- Legendary Kitys: Give your kittycats `pools = {["kity"] = true}` to enable them to be summoned by The Wand and The Bitz and to grant chips with Cat Cafe.
- Gym Buddy boosts: Give your enhancements a `config.extra.gymboost` of `"chips"`, `"xchips"`, `"mult"`, `"xmult"`, `"cash"`, `"hchips"`, `"hxchips"`, `"hmult"`, `"hxmult"`, `"hcash"` or `"none"` to have them grant the corresponding boost when scored with cards not of that enhancement. (If you don't, one will be chosen randomly each time. Which maybe you prefer!) 
- The Silliest, Littlest Deck: Add `pools = {["MintysSillyMod"] = true}` to have your cross-mod content appear with increased frequency when this deck is in play.
- Rocks: Add `minty_rock = true` to your enhancement definition to have it count as a rock. If this fails for priority reasons (which I don't _think_ should be possible, but you never know) there's a Lovely patch target in `lib/functions.lua`.

- [Mod thread on the Balatro Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1308185262664450068) is the most obvious choice for mod-related communication.
- There's also [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/V5Kbh8Q) <small>or well, one of them, i start so many things and never follow through lol</small>
- Does GitHub have messaging? It has [Discussions](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/MintysSillyMod/discussions), that'll have to do.
- Most reliable will be [Dreamwidth](https://wingedcatgirl.dreamwidth.org/). I'm not super _active_ there, but I can assure you it's not going away.
- I'm most active on [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/wingedcatgirl), though I don't trust the CEO of that site not to burn it all down without notice.

----
[^1]: Only if Spectrum Framework is active. Yes, there are other mods that add the Spectrum hand, but what's the point of having a framework if every mod has to account for every other mod. you know. If you're running those mods, add Spectrum Framework. Let _it_ account for every other mod.
