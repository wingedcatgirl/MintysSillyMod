  <summary>Config Options</summary>
<ul>
<li>Dev Mode: Default false. Requires restart. Enables unfinished content. Usually there isn't any because I don't like leaving things unfinished. But latest-commit enjoyers might catch me in the middle of something.</li>
<li>Flavor text: Default true. Enables funky MtG-style quotes at the bottom of some cards.</li>
</ul>

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded), if you haven't already.
   - **Minimum supported version is 1307a**, due to Better Calc completely overhauling a lot of things.
3. Download the code as a ZIP file, from the latest release in Releases (should be stable, may be missing features) or the green "Code" button (may be buggy, but all features are available).
   - If you need old-calc Steamodded for some reason, please download [old-calc Minty's Mod](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/MintysSillyMod/releases/tag/old-calc) as well; later versions are not kept compatible with old-calc.
4. Inside the zip file is the mod code in a folder, `MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION`. Put that folder in your Mods folder. The file structure should look like `Mods/MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION/MintysSillyMod.json`. In particular, there should _not_ be a second `MintysSillyMod` folder nested inside the first one. (You might prefer to remove the version number suffix from the folder name; it doesn't actually matter.)
5. Have a little 3 as a treat! :3

## To update to a newer version
1. Download the latest update.
2. Delete all files from your `Mods/MintysSillyMod` folder. (There's no save data in there, so you won't lose any progress.)
3. Unzip all the new files into the now-empty folder. Check again to make sure it's not nested.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Always start a new run after updating any mod. Attempting to continue an in-progress run may result in crashes.
