## Minty's Silly Little Mod

A silly little mod that adds some silly little jokers. [Spectrum Framework](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/SpectrumFramework) is recommended, but not strictly required.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded), if you haven't already. (Due to breaking changes, release **1204a** is the minimum requirement for Minty's Silly Little Mod.)
3. Download the code as a ZIP file, either from the latest release in Releases or from the "Code" button up above. (The "Code" button gets you the most recent commit, which will probably have both more features and more bugs. Release versions may lack new features, but should be reasonably bug-free.)
4. Inside the zip file is the mod code in a folder, `MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION`. Put that folder in your Mods folder. The file structure should look like `Mods/MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION/MintysSillyMod.json`. In particular, there should _not_ be a second `MintysSillyMod` folder nested inside the first one. (You might prefer to remove the version number suffix from the folder name; it doesn't actually matter.)
5. Have a little 3 as a treat! :3

## To update to a newer version
1. Download the latest update.
2. Delete all files from your `Mods/MintysSillyMod` folder. (There's no save data in there, so you won't lose any progress.)
3. Unzip all the new files into the now-empty folder. Check again to make sure it's not nested.
