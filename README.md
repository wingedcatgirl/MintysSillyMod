## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded), if you haven't already.
3. Download the code above as a ZIP file.
4. Inside the zip file is the mod code in a folder, `MintysSillyMod-main`. Put that folder in your Mods folder. The file structure should look like `Mods/MintysSillyMod-main/MintysSillyMod.json`. In particular, there should _not_ be a second `MintysSillyMod` folder inside the first one.
5. Have a little 3 as a treat! :3
