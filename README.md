## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded), if you haven't already.
   - **Minimum supported version for 0.5.0 is BETA-0312b**..
   - Minimum supported version for latest commit is also **BETA-0312b**.
3. Download the code as a ZIP file, from the latest release in Releases (should be stable, may be missing features) or the green "Code" button (may be buggy, but all features are available).
   - If you need old-calc Steamodded for some reason, please download [old-calc Minty's Mod](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/MintysSillyMod/releases/tag/old-calc) as well; later versions are not kept compatible with old-calc.
4. Inside the zip file is the mod code in a folder, `MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION`. Put that folder in your Mods folder. The file structure should look like `Mods/MintysSillyMod-SOMEVERSION/MintysSillyMod.json`. In particular, there should _not_ be a second `MintysSillyMod` folder nested inside the first one. (You might prefer to remove the version number suffix from the folder name; it doesn't actually matter.)
5. Have a little 3 as a treat! :3

## To update to a newer version
1. Download the latest update.
2. Delete all files from your `Mods/MintysSillyMod` folder. (There's no save data in there, so you won't lose any progress.)
3. Unzip all the new files into the now-empty folder. Check again to make sure it's not nested.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Always start a new run after updating any mod. Attempting to continue an in-progress run may result in crashes.

## Config Options
- Dev Mode: Default false. Requires restart. Enables unfinished content. Usually there isn't any because I don't like leaving things unfinished. But latest-commit enjoyers might catch me in the middle of something.
- Flavor text: Default true. Enables funky MtG-style quotes at the bottom of some cards.
- Include stable crossover content: Default false. Includes cross-mod content which doesn't actually rely on the other mod's code to function. Not really the intended experience (it'll bias the Joker pool toward 3s a lot), but you might prefer maximum access to things.

## Adding cross-mod interactions
- Legendary Kitys: Give your legendary kittycats `pools = {["kity"] = true}` to enable The Wand to summon them. Nothing interacts with non-legendary kittycats _yet_, but you can put them in the pool too for when/if we invent something.
- Gym Buddy boosts: Give your enhancements a `config.extra.gymboost` of `"chips"`, `"xchips"`, `"mult"`, `"xmult"`, `"cash"`, `"hchips"`, `"hxchips"`, `"hmult"`, `"hxmult"`, `"hcash"` or `"none"` to have them grant the corresponding boost when scored with cards not of that enhancement. (If you don't, one will be chosen randomly each time. Which maybe you prefer!)
